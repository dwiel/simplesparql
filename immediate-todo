			from sparql read to sparql write
			from translate read to sparql write
			make the image multiline thing work
			
			somehow allow each subquery to return each of the set of triples that go
				on to the next.  
			well ... The set of triples isn't really important.  Its the set of 
				bindings.
		
			Keep in mind cached compilations ... basically the partial compilation
		
	x	make change to allow different kinds of variables?
	x	make sure vars['x'] = [1,2,3] works as outlined in andandor

				vars['x'] = (1,2,3)
				vars['x'] = [1,2,(3,4),5]
		
		disallow input variables like bnode1
				...
