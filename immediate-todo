immidiate todo:

		make multiline work
			NEXT make subquery bindings able to pass on to the next subquery
			from sparql read to sparql write
			from translate read to sparql write
			make the image multiline thing work
			
			somehow allow each subquery to return each of the set of triples that go
				on to the next.  
			well ... The set of triples isn't really important.  Its the set of 
				bindings.
		
		!!! make compile !!! (is it really that hard?)
			given a query (complete or partial), find possible paths through the 
				set of translations.  Avoid doing any translation evaluation at this 
				point.
			The result should be a subgraph of sorts which is the new graph which 
				needs to be searched through to find the answer.  Ideally, this subgraph
				requires far less evaluation than the entire set of translations.
			Keep in mind cached compilations ... basically the partial compilation
		
	x	make change to allow different kinds of variables?
	-	make sure vars['x'] = [1,2,3] works as outlined in andandor
			its close enough. still left:
				vars['x'] = (1,2,3)
				vars['x'] = [1,2,(3,4),5]
				...
		make optional parts of a query and part of a translation work
