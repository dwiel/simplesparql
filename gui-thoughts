thoughts on interaction with GUI

single commands are easy to write and understand.

How would a set of them interact?

initial thought:
	draw out a GUI similar to visual basic and assign commands with events.
	
	avoid extra code ... This could essentially be done by giving each GUI event
		some unique structure and then writing translations for what that means.

	concerns:
		
		what if the GUI design needs to be generated on the fly?
		
		how are the GUI elements designed?




another thought:
	computer is an information portal.  You want to give it information and have 
		it respond with information.  In a word processor, the information in and 
		out are nearly identicle.  In a web search, the information in and out are
		extremely different.
	initial interaction would be a request for information:
		show me the document titled xyz (or open xyz)
		who is playing right now?
		play the beatles next
	
	There is information on the screen which can be used as context to do other
		things.  For example, you could right click an email and reply.  You could
		click the sort button to sort a list.

	concerns:
		
		what if the information is best presented not modularly?  This depends 
			exclusively on the rendering engine, not this model.
